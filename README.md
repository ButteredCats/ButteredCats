## Hello!

I don't do a whole lot on Github but I figured I'd throw this here anyways.

I host https://catsarch.com (also available over [Tor](http://catsarchywsyuss6jdxlypsw5dc7owd5u5tr6bujxb7o6xw2hipqehyd.onion/) and [I2P](http://s6dagpvf5ccnpkyjigjykkrbxwo6xgajm2hvvyyeaymm27qd2tpq.b32.i2p/)) plus all the other stuff shown on that page. Most of my contributions are related to the frontends shown there.

I can be reached at:
- [ButteredCats@protonmail.com](mailto:ButteredCats@protonmail.com) via email
- [@butteredcats:catsarch.com](https://matrix.to/#/@butteredcats:catsarch.com) through Matrix

Feel free to contact me for anything!
