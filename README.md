## Hello!

I'm a huge Linux and homelab nerd who originally made all the frontends I host public as a way to give back to their creators.

Now that I understand some stuff like HTML and CSS along with intermediate knowledge of a few progamming languages, I try to contribute to them where possible. So far most of my efforts have been towards [Redlib](https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib) as that's what I personally use the most.

I host https://catsarch.com (also available over [Tor](http://catsarchywsyuss6jdxlypsw5dc7owd5u5tr6bujxb7o6xw2hipqehyd.onion/) and [I2P](http://s6dagpvf5ccnpkyjigjykkrbxwo6xgajm2hvvyyeaymm27qd2tpq.b32.i2p/)) plus all the other stuff shown on that page.

I can be reached at:
- [ButteredCats@protonmail.com](mailto:ButteredCats@protonmail.com) via email ([PGP key](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=butteredcats%40protonmail.com))
- [@butteredcats:catsarch.com](https://matrix.to/#/@butteredcats:catsarch.com) through Matrix

Feel free to contact me for anything!
